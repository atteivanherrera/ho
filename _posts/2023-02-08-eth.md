In this post we're gonna check at the 20 weeks with the best and worst returns in the history of Ethereum, check at their distribution and 

These are the libraries we will use:

{% highlight python %}

import datetime 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm
import yfinance as yf

#we will then use the yfinance library to extract the information about the ETH-USD pair

#The historic prices are found in the method .history

ETH = yf.Ticker("ETH-USD")
ETH = ETH.history(period="max")

{% endhighlight %}

In this case since we're intereseted in working with the returns, to remove scale bias from the analysis

{% highlight python %}

def percentage_change(x):
    return (x[-1]-x[0])/x[0]

weekly_ETH_returns = ETH["Close"].resample("W").apply(percentage_change)

#our newly created 'weekly_ETH_returns' contains the returns for each week since the ETH has been traded

{% endhighlight %}


This will return a dataframe called ETH with data for the closing price

## Summary statistics

We're now gonna plot the returns histogram, agains the normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as our returns

{% highlight python %}

mu, stdev = norm.fit(weekly_ETH_returns)
plt.hist(weekly_ETH_returns, density=True, bins=30, alpha=0.5)

xmin, xmax = plt.xlim()
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)
p = norm.pdf(x, mu, stdev)
  
plt.plot(x, p, 'k', linewidth=2)
title = "Mean: {:.2f} and Standard deviation: {:.2f}".format(mu, stdev)
plt.title(title)

plt.show()

{% endhighlight %}

The next step is selecting the weeks with the greatest return.
